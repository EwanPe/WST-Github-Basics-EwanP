# WST-Github-Basics-EwanP
WST Repo Practice, for use in West Sound Tech 3D Graphics and Design class.
Wow, hi. I am Ewan P, I enjoy a lot of horror games, and atmospheric adventure games.
Some of the games I really enjoyed were: Signalis, Dead Space, and Silent Hill. 
I have played some other games that were alright, but not as good as the above, such as: Oneshot, Outer Wilds, Milk Outside a bag of Milk Outside a bag of Milk, and Lobotomy Corporation.

This is for the 3DG&D class of WST, this is a practice document that will be sent to someone, probably.
